# 32_Bit_Single_Cycle_Processor_Logism-
Ko√ß University Computer Architecture Project - COMP 303 - Fall 2016

This project requires Logism Software Please Download It.

In this project we will design and implement a 32-bit processor using Logisim. 
Logisim is a software logic simulator which provides basic components to build a simple processor. 
We will first design an ALU and use it in our processor.

We all know by now that the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is the most crucial part of a processor.  
Our ALU will support some operations from MIPS but not all the MIPS instructions. 

a) Subtructor:
For sub instruction, firstly 1 bit subtructor was implemented. Then, 32 bit subtructor was implemented using 1 bit subtructor. 

b) Adder
For add instruction first we implemented 1 bit adder. Then we implemented 32 bit adder using this 1 bit adder. 

For MULT op. lecture slides was used which is arithmetic lecture. 

For SLT operation first 1 bit SLT implemented than 32 bit SLT implemented. After several logical operations SLT only returns 1 or 0.

Note: When we finish the project, we realize that SLT is broken because of any reason.
